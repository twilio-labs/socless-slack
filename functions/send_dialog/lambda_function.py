    Args:
        context (dict): The state context object. This is included automatically by Socless Core and SHOULD NOT be
            supplied by the user when creating a playbook
        receiver (str): The name of the State in the playbook that will receive the dialog response
        trigger_id (str): trigger_id required to open a Dialog
        title (str): Dialog title
        elements (list): Dialog elements
        submit_label (str): Label for Dialog's submit button
        state (str): this string simply echoes back what your app passed to dialog.open. Use it as a pointer that
            references sensitive data stored elsewhere.

    Note:
        - See https://api.slack.com/dialogs for more details on to create elements for a slack dialog
        - This integration starts a Human Response workflow. When used in a playbook, it needs to be followed by a Task
          state that uses the _socless_outbound_message_response Activity to receive the response from a user
        - A user can respond to a dialog by either submitting it or cancelling it. The response payload contains a
          key named `type` that can be either `dialog_submission` or `dialog_cancellation`. In your playboks,
          be sure to check what type of response a user provided before acting on it.
